# Properties-Price-Prediction
In this project, we used the zameen.com dataset to figure out which variables affect property prices so that we can predict property prices.

Having a dataset containing for sale properties' ads during one year could assist a lot
in predicting property prices. Especially if we could catch which variables affect
property prices.

The goal here is to provide High accurate predictions through this data to assist any
real estate developer in Islamabad in defining the right prices of their properties
without being over or underpriced
